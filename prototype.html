        <h1 id="persona-first-line">Meet Jason Biggs</h1>
        <br>
        <p>A 29 year old Analyst for Booz Allen Hamilton, he's trying to earn a promotion. Jason is always the first into the office, and last to leave. Unfortunately, living in Clarendon on the Orange Line comes with unexpected and unnecessary commuting issues. Though he's athletic, he'd prefer to not have to complete a track and field course around the confused tourists trying to figure out the Metro. Jason would love to use this app to bypass congestion and have access to an accurate trip planner.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Jason hates having to miss his preferred train due to standing at the kiosks to reload his SmarTrip. He would prefer to bypass them.</p>
        <br>
        <p>He is sometimes a few minutes late to work due to having to wait on line to re-fill his negative balance SmarTrip. He'd prefer to be able to reload his card before exiting the station.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Jason's company pays for his commute expenses. As a result, he has a hard time budgeting/accounting for his commute expenses versus his personal/weekend expenses.</p>
